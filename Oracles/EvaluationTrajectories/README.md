Drop your input trajectories for the evaluation in this directory.

You can name the file as `FirstnameLastname.txt`. The content of the file follows the same structure as the tests, except that no expected value (and precision) should be mentioned in the file. The expected value should rather be declared via [this form](https://forms.gle/h4XMycubvt45DUAA7).
